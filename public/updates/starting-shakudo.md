title: Received College of Computing Fellowship
date: 5-12-20
description: I received a fellowship to develop a block-based language interface into the Alloy language and analyzer. This will allow users to express mathematical constraints and get feedback from the analyzer while abstracting away syntactic details of the language by the use of blocks.

Discrete math is a foundational topic for Computer Science. Undergraduate computer
science students enroll in a course at some point in their college career focusing on
topics in discrete math including set theory, relational algebra, and predicate logic.
These courses are extremely important for students as they form the basis of analysis in
the field. Analysis of so-called cyber-physical systems, where computer and physical
systems interact, is especially important, as shown by public issues like the recent
Boeing 737 Max; if Boeing engineers had employed more discrete analytical thinking,
they may have avoided the issues Boeing is facing today.

CS students typically donâ€™t get the kind of interactive practice with math that they do
with programming in languages like Java. As a result, misconceptions can persist, and
students can develop an attitude that discrete math has no applicability to their field.
Progressive CS departments have included interactive tools in their curriculum to assist
students with the learning of such topics. Here at Michigan Tech, instructors in the
College of Computing have created a curriculum involving the use of the Alloy modeling
tool. Alloy consists of two parts: (1) a programming language based on the
mathematical languages of relational algebra and predicate logic, and (2) an application
for finding instances (situations) that follow (or break) the requirements set by an Alloy
program. Alloy is a powerful tool for modeling real world systems. Giving students an
opportunity to use Alloy provides them an authentic sense of math in their field.

Alloy provides more feedback to students than traditional pencil-and-paper exercises;
however the experience could be better for first-time students. When students work with
Alloy, it can be daunting because while they are trying to develop models they may
become burdened with small syntactical issues they may not be familiar with as a
beginner. Adding to this, the base error messages provided by Alloy can be confusing
because they are tailored towards experts and not first time users.
