After our presentation of T-REX, the director of NASA, Jim Bridenstine announced that our team had won the entire
competition. We were all extremely grateful for the opportunity.

> "We were ecstatic to be awarded the Artemis Award and honored that Adminstrator Bridenstine was there to hand the award out himself," said Paul van Susante, Ph.D., Michigan Technological University's faculty advisor and head of the school's Planetary Surface Technology Development Laboratory. "We have a very young team of mostly undergraduate students who were very enthusiastic and motivated. I was incredibly impressed how quickly they shifted to work through the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and we plan on continuing our work to develop this concept further."
