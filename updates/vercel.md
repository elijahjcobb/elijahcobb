I am excited to share that I just accepted a position at Vercel. I will be working as a Full Stack Engineer starting
April 11th. I use Vercel's solutions on an everyday basis. I cannot wait to join the team developing them. After a
couple of months in my Ph.D. program I realized it was not for me. Although I am extremely thankful for the support of my
advisors, I am excited to start this next chapter of my life.
